- create point array with #particles given from function caller and make miniQuad an array
- save vtk file so that it contains #particles per quad -> output is displayable as heatmap
- add simple velocity field into particle_move aka update_x
- refine as soon as we have more than 5 particles in a quad
- coarsen if all given siblings have together less than 5 particles
- move particle to proc to which enclQuad belongs
- handle particle ID in parallel - until now every proc is asigning his own bunch of IDs -> this could result in confusion when sending particle to other procs
- moving particles should be collected and pigeon-holed at the end of one time step, this speeds up a lot (comparison picture!)
- to generate some nice simulations, consider inserting as many particles randomized each timestep as there are particles deleted due to crossing the worlds border
