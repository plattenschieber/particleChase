- create point array with #particles given from function caller and make miniQuad an array
- move particle to proc to which enclQuad belongs
- handle particle ID in parallel - until now every proc is asigning his own bunch of IDs -> this could result in confusion when sending particle to other procs
- moving particles should be collected and pigeon-holed at the end of one time step, this speeds up a lot (comparison picture!)
- to generate some nice simulations, consider inserting as many particles randomized each timestep as there are particles deleted due to crossing the worlds border
- if particle lies on an edge, it gets assigned to two quads
