- move particle to proc to which enclQuad belongs
- handle particle ID in parallel - until now every proc is asigning his own bunch of IDs -> this could result in confusion when sending particle to other procs
- to generate some nice simulations, consider inserting as many particles randomized each timestep as there are particles deleted due to crossing the worlds border
