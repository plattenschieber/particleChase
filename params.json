{"name":"particleChase","tagline":"parallel high scalable particle chasing","body":"### Welcome to particleChase - the parallel particle chaser\r\nWe provide here the most basic but high scalable version of a particle chaser for a given velocity field.  Due to the underlying amazing fast [p4est](https://github.com/cburstedde/p4est) forest of octree structure - which proved to work in peta-scale (e.g. on Jaguar Cray XT5) - this work can easily be adapted to implement more complex algorithms like the Fast Multipole Method.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\nTo test it on your computer, several steps are needed.\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/plattenschieber/p4est \"my fork which has only a little change in the vtk output \r\n$ cd p4est\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/plattenschieber/particleChase\r\n$ ./bootstrap \"please make sure that which version of (g)libtoolize you use\r\n$ ./configure --enable-mpi \"--enable-debug\r\n$ make\r\n$ make install\r\n$ mpirun -np 4 particleChase/particleChase \r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
